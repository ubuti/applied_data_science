# Applied Data Science 

A collection of applied data engineering, data wrangling and analysis enhanced with *Machine Learning* models. 

The ressources such as data sets and software are publicly available.

Anybody can reproduce and modify according to personal needs. 

It is recommended to register at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) for most of the datasets used and many more are attainble here. 

A usable environment is also provided in the environment.yml file for those using ```python venv``` or ```conda/anaconda```.

If needed, a docker container can used as well.

A quick check of the ```requirements``` file will tell whether actions are needed.
